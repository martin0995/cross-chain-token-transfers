# Cross-Chain Token Transfer

This repository demonstrates how to deploy and interact with smart contracts for transferring ERC-20 tokens across different blockchains using the Wormhole Protocol.

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, make sure you have the following:

 - [Node.js and npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
 - [Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) (for compiling and testing smart contracts)
 - A funded wallet with testnet tokens for deployment and transfers

 ## Getting Started

 1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/martin0995/cross-chain-token-transfers
    cd cross-chain-token-transfers
```

2. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
    npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your `private key`:

```bash
    PRIVATE_KEY=INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY
```

> **_NOTE:_** This private key should be funded with testnet tokens on the chains you want to use.

4. Configure the chains:

Edit the `config.js` file to include the chain IDs, contract addresses, and RPC URLs for the chains you want to use.

5. Compile the smart contracts:

```bash
    forge compile
```

## Deployment

To deploy the smart contracts:

```bash
    npm run deploy
```

 - You will be prompted to select the **`source`** and **`target`** chains for deployment.
 - The deployed contract addresses will be saved and updated in `deploy-config/contracts.json`.

## Token Transfer

To initiate a token transfer across chains:

```bash
    npm run transfer
```

 - You will be prompted to select the **`source`** and **`target`** chains for the transfer.
 - Provide the token address, recipient address on the target chain, and the amount to transfer.

## Recommended Test Setup: Transfer USDC

To test the cross-chain transfer, I recommend using the **USDC token**, as itâ€™s widely supported across different testnets.

 - USDC Token Address on Avalanche Fuji: `0x5425890298aed601595a70ab815c96711a31bc65`
 - USDC Token Address on Celo Alfajores: `0x2F25deB3848C207fc8E0c34035B3Ba7fC157602B`

You can obtain USDC on testnets via the official USDC faucet:

 - [USDC Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/)

 Once you have USDC, use the provided addresses above to transfer between testnets.

## Contracts Overview

The project includes two main contracts:

 - **`CrossChainSender`** - handles sending tokens from the source chain
 - **`CrossChainReceiver`** - handles receiving tokens on the target chain

## Project Structure

 - **`src/`** - contains the Solidity smart contracts
 - **`script/`** - contains TypeScript scripts for deployment and token transfers
 - **`deploy-config/`** - configuration files for the chains and deployed contracts
 - **`out/`** - contains the compiled contract ABIs and bytecode

## Notes

 - Ensure your wallet has enough testnet tokens to cover gas fees on both the source and target chains.
 - The current setup supports ERC-20 tokens like WETH, USDC, and WBTC.
